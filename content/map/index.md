## 2024 Public Transit Usage
*22 Apr, 2025*

Here's a map of my Ontario public transit usage last year! Each dot is a station at which I tapped on. You can zoom out to see my visits to Waterloo and Guelph.

I downloaded the data through my PrestoCard account. This was almost entirely vibes coded with Gemini, save some manual coordinate searching for stations that were clearly incorrect. 

Other than a new, highly frequented dot at Yonge-Eglinton, I predict my 2025 public transit usage will look fairly similar. I plan to spend time exploring the East end this summer but that will largely be done on foot or bike- Thomas and I walked to the Beaches from campus a few weeks ago and it was very pleasant :)
