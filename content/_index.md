I'm a second-year at the University of Toronto, where I study Finance, Economics, and Contemporary Asian Studies. I compete for the Hart House Debating Club and lead the campus Effective Altruism chapter. 

From May to August, I'll be a summer credit analyst at RBC Capital Markets. I was an Atlas Fellow in 2023 and an intern at the Effective Institutions Project in 2024.

I'm currently interested in public finance (specifically insurers of last resort) and feminist perspectives on reproduction. When I'm not dilly-dallying, I enjoy reading fiction, practising calisthenics, and sewing clothes.
