## About Me:

I'm a student at the University of Toronto. I study Finance, Economics, and Contemporary Asian Studies.

I believe in the abundance agenda: I think most public good is downstream of cheap power and dynamic housing. Outside of that, I'm interested in anthropology and gender.

Last summer, I worked in credit at an investment bank. In my past, I was an Effective Altruist, a debate coach, and a vet assistant.

These days I identify most as a humanist. I try to have good epistemics and live the good life.
