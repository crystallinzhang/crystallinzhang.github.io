## About

I'm a student at the University of Toronto. I study Finance, Economics, and Contemporary Asian Studies.

Last summer, I worked in credit at an investment bank. In my past, I was an Effective Altruist, a debate coach, and a vet assistant. These days I identify most as a humanist. 

I try to have good epistemics and live the good life. I would like to add differential value to the world and I am exploring what that looks like. If you have ideas, send me an email.
