## Hi,

I'm a student at the University of Toronto. I study Finance, Economics, and Contemporary Asian Studies. I compete for the Hart House Debating Club and lead the campus Effective Altruism chapter. 

From May to August, I'm a summer credit analyst at RBC Capital Markets. I was an Atlas Fellow in 2023 and an intern at the Effective Institutions Project in 2024. I am sometimes a debate coach.

I will be in Cambridge, UK from August 4-9.
