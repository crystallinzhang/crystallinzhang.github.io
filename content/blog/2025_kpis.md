I had a good summer, a heartbreaking summer. But it's now fall [so, we'll go no more a roving](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/43845/so-well-go-no-more-a-roving).

Here are my targets for this semester:
- Be more social (go out >1x a week, make >1 new Rotman friend)
- Feel good (exercise >3x week, eat health packed lunch >3x a week)
- Get smarter (rec read anthro papers weekly, financial news daily)
- Increase charisma (befriend a prof, talk to a stranger daily)
- Be good at debating (spar 2x a week, break at Worlds)

Wish me luck.
